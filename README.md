# Horreror
This is the front-end part of the project, built using React, located inside the `client` directory. Below are the instructions to run the React app locally, allowing you to edit and see the changes in real-time.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js**: Download and install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).  
- **npm**: Node Package Manager, which comes with Node.js, is used to install the dependencies.

### Steps to Run the React Front-End
1. **Open a terminal and navigate to the `client` directory**:
   ```bash
   cd client
2. **Install all the required libraries and dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install all the necessary npm packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
3. **Start the React app**:
   To run the app locally, execute:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
   - Once the app starts successfully, it will open in your default web browser. Any changes you make to the code will automatically refresh the browser.

### Editing the Code
   After following the steps above, you can now edit the code in the client directory. Any changes you make to the React components will immediately reflect in the browser.

### Additional Notes
   - If you run into any issues, make sure your Node.js version is `20.x.x` and npm to be up to date.
   - By default, the app will run on http://localhost:3000. If that port is already in use, it will automatically suggest an alternative.
